[![Monthly Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/ousamabenyounes/log2test/d/monthly.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/ousamabenyounes/log2test)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ousamabenyounes/log2test.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/ousamabenyounes/log2test) [![SensioLabsInsight](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/d9e3c01e-7bea-4705-8b0b-f6273dac5b09/mini.png)](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/d9e3c01e-7bea-4705-8b0b-f6273dac5b09)

Log2Test is a PHP application that allows you to **transform your Production Log into test**.  
You can export your log to the following stack:  
- **Curl**: Php Multi Curl Test => A good solution if you have huge apache2 log file or if you don't Need to run Javascript or Ajax calls  
- **PhpunitCurl**:  Phpunit Curl test   
- **PhpunitSelenium**: Allows you to open all your log file url's on defined browsers you need to test  

Why exporting your log production's files to tests?

- Be able to **find broken links**  
- Detect Blan   k/Empty web pages (When a 500 error occurs and no error redirection page is enabled)
- Before sending new features in production, you can **easily launch real tests for your pre-production**  
- Launching all your access log on different browsers with Selenium allows you to **validate Cross Browser Compatibility**  

# Install

```
git clone https://github.com/ousamabenyounes/log2test 
composer install
```

# How to use

**Let's now see how Log2Test works step by step as seen on screencast gif file bellow**
- At the beginning, **no existing tests** on "generated/Curl" directory
- Given this context:  
  - A configuration file (Yaml File) -> config/parameters-log2test.yml   
  - An Apache2 Access Log file -> log/test.log   
- Running **./bin/log2test** command will **generate and run all your tests**

# Configuration

Open configuration file:  

```
config/parameters-log2test.yml 
```


Here are all configuration's file properties:

| Property | Type | Description | Default | 
|:----------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|---------------|
| host | Array | List of host to parse [see samples here](#host-sample) | |
| logFile | String | Path to your acces log File | log/test.log |
| testStack | String | Available test stack: "PhpunitSelenium" or "Curl" or "PhpunitCurl | Curl |
| beginLine | Int | Begin parsing at line X | 0 |
| numberOfLine | Int | Number of line to parse | 300 |
| logParserClass | String | Your log parsing class | \Log2Test\Apache2LogParser |
| logFormat | String | Detail the log format of your acces log file | '%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b' |
| extensions_allowed | Array | Only parse file matching these extentions | [php, html] |
| browsers | Array | List of browsers -> only for phpunit_selenium stack | chrome |  
| removeDuplicateUrl | Boolean | If you want to remove duplicate urls | true |
| pauseBetweenTests | Int | Add a pause between all generated tests | 0 |
| encodedUrls | Boolean | Allows you to encode all parsed urls | true |
| enabledScreenshot | Boolean | Take screenshot on each test | false |
| testResultFormat | string | Test result format "xml" or "json" | xml |




# Requirements
Phpunit  
Selenium Server (only needed if you choose phpunit_selenium for your test stack)  


# Test
Log2test is tested with PHPUNIT & Behat

```
./bin/phpunit 

./bin/behat
```

Each commit, a complete build is launched on http://travis-ci.org/ousamabenyounes/log2test/

### Host Sample

You can provide simple array of string like this:

```php
[
    "www.shop2tout.com",
    "www.epitech.fr"
    ...
]
```

You can also provide an array of array (source / destination) 

```php
[
    ["www.sourcehost.com", "www.destinationhost.local"],
    ["www.sourcehost2.com", "www.destinationhost2.local"],
    ["www.shop2tout.com", "www.shop2tout.local"],
    ...
]
```

The first case is the source host you will be searching on your apache logs  
The second case is the destiation host wich will be used on generated test  
By this way, you won't be launching your test on your production website will should affect your real production stats  
**That's why we recommand you to use the second format**

# Todo
Add Global Reporting  
Add YellowLabTool option on parsing
